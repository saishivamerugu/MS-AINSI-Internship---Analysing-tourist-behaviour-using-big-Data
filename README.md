# MS-AINSI-Internship---Analysing-tourist-behaviour-using-big-Data
A Big Data-driven project to analyze tourist behavior using data from social media, travel apps, GPS, and reviews. It helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions by identifying travel patterns, preferences, and satisfaction trends.
📊 Analyzing Tourist Behaviour Using Big Data

📌 Project Overview
This project leverages Big Data technologies to analyze and understand tourist behavior by collecting and processing large volumes of structured and unstructured data from sources such as social media, travel websites, mobile applications, GPS systems, and online reviews.

Tourism stakeholders often lack timely insights into tourist preferences and behavior trends, which leads to poor decision-making and missed opportunities. Our system aims to bridge this gap by providing data-driven insights to improve tourism planning, enhance visitor satisfaction, and support economic development in tourist destinations.
